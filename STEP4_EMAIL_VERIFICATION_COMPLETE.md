ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS verification_token TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS verification_token_expires TIMESTAMPTZ;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_verification_token 
ON users(verification_token) WHERE verification_token IS NOT NULL;

UPDATE users SET email_verified = true 
WHERE provider = 'google' AND email_verified = false;
```

### 4. Test Locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

1. Sign up at http://localhost:3001/auth/signup
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click link to verify
4. Sign in and access dashboard

### 5. Deploy to Production
