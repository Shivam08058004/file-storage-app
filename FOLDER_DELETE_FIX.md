# 🐛 Fixed: Folder Deletion Issue

## Issue
Created folders couldn't be deleted. When clicking delete on a folder, nothing would happen.

## Root Cause
The delete API route had two problems:

1. **URL vs Key Confusion**: Folders don't have URLs (they're just markers), but the delete handler was expecting a URL format and trying to extract the S3 key from it.

2. **No Recursive Deletion**: When deleting a folder, the code only deleted the folder marker (`.foldermarker` file) but didn't delete the contents inside the folder.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed S3 Key Extraction
Updated the delete route to handle both URL format (for files) and direct S3 keys (for folders):

```typescript
// Before: Only worked with URLs
const s3Key = url.split(".amazonaws.com/")[1]

// After: Works with both URLs and direct keys
const s3Key = url.includes(".amazonaws.com/") 
  ? url.split(".amazonaws.com/")[1] 
  : url
```

### 2. Implemented Recursive Folder Deletion
When deleting a folder:
1. Extract the folder path from the S3 key
2. Query database for all files/subfolders within that folder
3. Delete each item from both S3 and database
4. Finally delete the folder marker itself

```typescript
if (file.is_folder) {
  // Get folder path (e.g., "folder1" or "parent/child")
  const folderPath = extractFolderPath(s3Key)
  
  // Find all contents
  const itemsToDelete = folderContents.filter(item => {
    return item.parent_folder === folderPath || 
           item.parent_folder.startsWith(`${folderPath}/`)
  })
  
  // Delete each item
  for (const item of itemsToDelete) {
    await storage.deleteFile(item.s3_key)
    await database.delete(item.id)
  }
}
```

### 3. Added Better User Feedback
Added toast notifications to show:
- ✅ Success: "Deleted successfully"
- ❌ Error: "Delete failed" with error message
- ⚠️ Exception: "An error occurred while deleting"

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. ✅ Delete empty folder
2. ✅ Delete folder with files inside
3. ✅ Delete folder with subfolders
4. ✅ Delete folder with nested structure (folder/subfolder/file)
5. ✅ Delete regular file (unchanged behavior)

### How to Test
1. Create a folder: Click "New" → "Folder"
2. Upload files into the folder
3. Create subfolders inside the folder
4. Click the three dots on the folder
5. Click "Delete"
6. Confirm deletion
7. ✅ Folder and all contents should be deleted
8. ✅ Storage quota should update correctly

## Files Modified

### `app/api/files/delete/route.ts`
- Added support for direct S3 keys (not just URLs)
- Implemented recursive folder deletion
- Added logging for debugging
- Added email verification error handling

### `app/page.tsx`
- Added `useToast` hook import
- Enhanced `handleDelete` with toast notifications
- Better error handling and user feedback

## Technical Details

### Folder Structure in Database
- Folders are stored with `is_folder = true`
- Folder S3 key: `userId/folderPath/.foldermarker`
- Files in folder have `parent_folder` set to the folder path
- Example:
  ```
  userId/folder1/.foldermarker          → Folder
  userId/folder1/timestamp-file.txt     → File in folder
  userId/folder1/subfolder/.foldermarker → Subfolder
  ```

### Deletion Logic
1. Check if item `is_folder`
2. If folder:
   - Extract folder path by removing `userId/` prefix and `/.foldermarker` suffix
   - Query for all items where `parent_folder` matches or starts with folder path
   - Delete each item (S3 + database)
3. Delete the folder marker or file
4. Database trigger automatically updates `storage_used`

## Impact
- ✅ Folders can now be deleted
- ✅ Folder contents are cleaned up properly
- ✅ Storage quota updates correctly
- ✅ No orphaned files in S3
- ✅ Better user experience with feedback

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] Add confirmation with item count: "Delete folder with 5 items?"
- [ ] Show progress for large folder deletions
- [ ] Add "Move to Trash" instead of permanent delete
- [ ] Batch delete operations for better performance
- [ ] Add undo functionality

---

✅ **Issue Fixed!** Folders can now be deleted properly with all their contents.
